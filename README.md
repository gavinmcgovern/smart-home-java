# Cloud-to-cloud integrations: Smart Home sample using Java

This sample contains a fully functioning example of a Smart Home provider cloud
service. This sample is intended to be used together with a Smart Home project
you create in the [Google Home Developer Console](https://console.home.google.com), to demonstrate how to integrate
smart devices with the Google Assistant.

This sample includes the following features to help you get started:

- Fulfillment backend for Cloud-to-cloud integrations.
- Mocked user authentication backend which comes prepopulated with sample users.
- Web frontend with an interactive experience for users to control smart devices.

## Get the sample source files

See the developer guide and release notes at [https://developers.google.com/assistant](https://developers.google.com/assistant) for more details.

Clone the project and the included frontend as a subdirectory:

```
git clone https://github.com/actions-on-google/smart-home-java.git
cd smart-home-java
git clone https://github.com/actions-on-google/smart-home-frontend.git
```

## Run the sample

### Set up the Cloud-to-cloud integration

1. Use the [Developer console](https://console.home.google.com) to create a new project by clicking **New Project**.
1. Enter a name of your choosing in the text box and click **Create Project**.
1. Select the **Smart Home**, then click **Start Building**.

### Optional: Customize the integration

1. From the top menu under **Develop**, click **Invocation**.
1. Add your integration's name. Click **Save**.
1. From the top menu under **DEPLOY**, click **Directory Information**.
1. Add your integration info, including images, a contact email, and privacy policy. This information can all be edited before submitting for review.
1. Click **Save**.

### Add Request Sync and Report State support
The [Request
Sync](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/request-sync)
feature allows your cloud integration to send a request to Home Graph to
send a new SYNC request. The [Report
State](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/develop/report-state)
feature allows your cloud integration to proactively provide the current state of
devices to Home Graph without a `QUERY` request.

1. Navigate to the
[Google Cloud Console API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
for your project ID.
1. Enable the [HomeGraph API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/homegraph.googleapis.com/overview).
1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console API & Services page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Select **Create Credentials** > **Service account**.
    1. Provide a name for the service account and click **Create and continue**.
    1. Select the role **Service Account Token Creator** and click **Continue**.
    1. Click **Done**.
1. Create a key for the service account key account, and download the JSON file.
    1. Click the pencil icon beside the newly created service account.
    1. Select **Keys** > **Add Key** > **Create new key**.
    1. Create JSON key and save the file as `src/main/resources/smart-home-key.json`.

### Connect to Firebase

1. Open your project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
1. Select **Build** > **Firestore database**.
1. Create a new database by clicking **Create database**.
    1. Select the appropriate security rules for your database and click **Next** (We recommend using **test mode** for development, and updating your rules to **production mode** later.).
    1. Select a Firestore location from the dropdown and click **Enable**.
1. From the data tab, select **Start collection** to configure a `users` collection with a default user and a few default fields

```
    users\
        1234
            fakeAccessToken: "123access"
            fakeRefreshToken: "123refresh"
            homegraph: false
```
**Note**: If you are not using Google App Engine to host your server, but still want to
integrate with Firestore:
- Set the `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable to the name of the Firebase project.
- Read [this guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) on setting up the Firebase Admin SDK.

### Deploy backend to App Engine

1. Run `./gradlew build`
1. Run `./gradlew appengineDeploy`

### Run frontend locally

1. Set up the web frontend

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run create-firebase-config
npm run serve
```

1. Open the web frontend URL.
1. Add new virtual devices and configure them as you please.
1. Click the cloud icon to enable it for cloud control.

### Start testing

1. Navigate back to the [Developer console](https://console.home.google.com).
1. From the top menu under **Develop**, click on **Cloud-to-cloud** (left nav). Click **Add integration** and choose your app's language(s).
1. Enter the URL for fulfillment and click **Done**.
    1. If using Google App Engine, the URL will be https://{project-id}.appspot.com/smarthome
1. On the left navigation menu under **ADVANCED OPTIONS**, click on **Account Linking**.
    1. Select **No, I only want to allow account creation on my website**. Click **Next**.
    1. For Linking Type, select **OAuth**.
    1. For Grant Type, select **Authorization Code** for Grant Type.
    1. Under Client Information, enter the client ID and secret as defined below:
        * Client Id: `sampleClientId`
        * Client Secret: `sampleClientSecret`
1. The Authorization URL is the hosted URL of your app with `/fakeauth` as the
path
    1. If using Google App Engine, the URL will be https://{project-id}.appspot.com/fakeauth
1. The Token URL is the hosted URL of your app with `/faketoken` as the path
    1. If using Google App Engine, the URL will be https://{project-id}.appspot.com/faketoken
